# Computer Vision RPS
Milestone 1 - task 1:
I have set up GitHub and created a GitHub repo to track my code and save them onine whilst creating the Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors game.

Milestone 2 - task 1:
In this task I had to create an image project model with 4 different classes that would be a part of a game - Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The "Nothing" class will present the lack of movement. The model that I used to create these 4 classes is a web-based tool called Teachable-Machine.

Milestone 2 - task 2:
After creating the 4 different classes for the image project model, I download the model from the "Tensorflow" tab in the Teachable-Machine tool. The 2 files that are downloaded were keras_model.h5, which is a model structure and labels.txt, which is the parameters of a deep learning model. These 2 files cannot be run but will be loaded into the Python application.
